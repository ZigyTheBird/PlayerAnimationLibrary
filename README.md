A library that allows mods to animate the player, in a way that doesn't conflict with other mods. (and much more!)  
This mod is a library for mod developers, and does not do anything on it's own.

Here are SOME of the features:
* You can load animations from Blender and Blockbench JSON files. (GeckoLib and Bedrock format)
* Pretty good molang support!
* Effect keyframes support like particle keyframes.
* Ability to add custom pivot points (for example a hip bone that rotates everything except the legs around the hip)
* Ability to add custom bones the location of which you can get in order to add custom particles.
