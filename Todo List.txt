Make a good way to test the mod with lots of test anims using different features of the mod
Make an API for playing anims server side and using commands (kind of like https://github.com/ZigyTheBird/ZigysPlayerAnimatorAPI/wiki/Getting-Started but with less shit code)
Make a great wiki for the mod (a dedicated website where older versions of the wiki are saved like the neoforge wiki)
Add compat with og player animator
Do what the "//Todo" comments in the code say
Blockbench plugin that supports exporting player anims with extra bones
Make an MC independent module
Port to older MC versions (at least to 1.21)
Website/Script/App to convert legacy animation formats to bedrock ones
Make sure the anim loading process located in the PlayerAnimCache class and the classes in the loading package is thread safe
Epic fight + Vampirism + Werewolves compat (if we port to 1.20.1 or they port to 1.21)
Make sure all legacy animation formats and versions are supported
Make a new fade system (I don't like the old one)
Fix adjustment modifier
